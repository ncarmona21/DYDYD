# DYDYD - Did you do your dishes?
An Amazon DeepLens project to remind office staff to do their dishes.

## Goals
The overall goal of this project is to explore the possibilities of the DeepLens camera and gain a familiarity with the DeepLens tooling.

## Basic Functionality
The DYDYD project should perform the following:
* Capture imagery of an individual
* Identify the individual either as a known individual or a known person to be ignored
* Identify the individual as a new person
* Prompt for input on slack as to a new person's identity
* Capture imagery of the sink after a visit by an individual
* Assess the visit of the individual (did they add or remove dishes)
* Remind an individual via slack that they may still have dishes in the sink

## Set up
